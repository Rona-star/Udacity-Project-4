# Starbucks Capstone Challenge

## Overview
In this project, we dive into a fascinating dataset that simulates how people make purchasing decisions and how those decisions are influenced by promotional offers. Through careful analysis, we aim to uncover insights into customer behavior and preferences, ultimately building a recommendation engine tailored to Starbucks.

## Project Motivation
As part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree program on Udacity, this project is designed to address business questions like preferred offers by gender, age group impacts, effective channels for conversions, and relationships between income level and offer completion.

## Dependencies
To run this project smoothly, ensure you have Python Anaconda installed, preferably using Python version 3.11.5. We utilize essential libraries such pandas as pd, numpy as np, math, json, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, seaborn as sns, datetime, warnings, seaborn as sns for data manipulation and visualization.

## File Descriptions
Our analysis revolves around three main datasets:
- **portfolio.json**: Provides details of different promotional offers.
- **profile.json**: Contains demographic information of customers.
